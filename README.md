# Yo, I'm Galih! 👋

> "Just a human trying to build cool things with Code."

### 🤷‍♂️ Who?
I'm an Informatics student at **Telkom University**.
Basically, I write code for the web and sometimes I make 3D art because I like things to look good.

### 🎒 My Weapons
Stuff I use to make things happen:

**Code**

![Laravel](https://img.shields.io/badge/Laravel-FF2D20?style=flat-square&logo=laravel&logoColor=white)
![TailwindCSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tailwind_CSS-38B2AC?style=flat-square&logo=tailwind-css&logoColor=white)

**Art & Tools**

### 📂 What's in here?
This is basically my digital garage. You'll find:
* 🎓 **Campus Stuff:** Assignments (typical student life stuff).
* 🧪 **Experiments:** Me trying out new tech (honestly just FOMO most of the time).
* 🚀 **Real Projects:** Apps that actually work (hopefully).
